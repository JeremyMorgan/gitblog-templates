<p>Welcome to my GitHub page. I'm trying out [Wintersmith][1] and figured this would be a good place to give it a test run.</p>
<p>I have no idea what I'll put here but maybe someday I'll put something useful here. </p>
<p>For now you can check out some of my lame repos:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/JeremyMorgan/ipcountrycode">Ip to Country Code lookup&nbsp;service</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/JeremyMorgan/firecom">FireCom</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/JeremyMorgan/staticpagetest">Static Page&nbsp;Test</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/JeremyMorgan/AdSenseCalculator">Angular AdSense&nbsp;Calulator</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/JeremyMorgan/rubywebcompress">Ruby Web&nbsp;Compressor</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I'll try to put something more interesting up here. No promises. </p>
<p>So far I like [Wintersmith][1] it's really easy to work with, it uses a pretty forward thinking and smart design, plus I like the minimalist look and feel of the output. I'll surely use it on some project soon. </p>
